# Weather App

This is a weather app with values from Openweather API

* HTML used to structure the the interface.

* With CSS, the look and feel of the page is brought to life. The body has a photo background blurred by application of the "body::before" class. Colour choice is a cool, feely one. Linear-gradient(to the top) was applied to the main-container. Icons on the page are from googleIcons and Fontawesome. Flex was used to create some alignments.

* 404 and search city pages are displayed when there are supposed to be using javascript. The 404 page comes up when the City inputted is invalid or not in the API. Values are fetched from the API using functions and aided by variables.
